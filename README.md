# JS clip view
 *JS clip view* is a simple web app to display and change the contents of your clipboard. It uses [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API), with is not the best choice, cause it goes through a phraser before going to the browser. For now, it can't read everything, only [supported formats](https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/#reading-from-clipboard). There is an [editor's draft](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5682768497344512) of Raw Clipboard Access api, but it's not implemented in any browsers yet.
